# 360-420-DW 2022 [Dawson College](http://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca)
This workspace is for all code used for
teaching Introductory Python to Science students

You can read the files directly from the git server interface,  you can copy them individually, 
use the raw format if you do so. Or you can download everything, on the main page there is a button to download as a zip file: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1751207/149207755-39ce3c9e-033b-4309-8014-55cf0588ed05.png)

## Dev set up
### use repl.it
Follow the teacher's instructions to create an account
* [repl.it](https://replit.com/)
### Own computer (optional)
* Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) choose the latest of v3
* Use any text editor, I really like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  on Windows or Linux so I use that as an editor
## lecture slides (for reference)
[onedrive shared](https://collegedawson-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pcampbell_dawsoncollege_qc_ca/Eq-UO667LqFLmLbB19zqLKABHEbkX8xkKDeVk6-rRSbGyw?e=UqzgsX) material shared by the teacher, lecture slides, assignments, etc.
## running the code samples 
Python is interpreted so it checks your code & runs it
For example I have a file hello.py:
```python
#  My first program
#  PCampbell
#  2022-01-12
print("hello world!")
```
Process & run it:
```bash
tricia@dc140:~/tmp$ python hello.py
hello world!
```
