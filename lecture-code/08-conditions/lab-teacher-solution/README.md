There are two functions in [main.py](main.py)  that implement the zellers congruence algorithm to find the day of week, given month, day, year. 

* `zellers()` implements the algorithm correctly, using integer (floor) division
* `zellers_error()`   implements the algorithm incorrectly, using floating point division
